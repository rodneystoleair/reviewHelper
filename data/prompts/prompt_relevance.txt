3. Determine Relevance: Decide if the paper should be included in the literature review based on its relevance to the research questions.
Scoring Criteria:
5 points: The title and abstract explicitly indicate that the paper addresses one or more of the research questions fully or their specific aspects.
4 points: The title and abstract suggest that the paper likely addresses one or more of the research questions fully or their specific aspects.
3 points: The title and abstract imply that the paper may address one or more of the research questions, but it is not certain.
2 points: The paper is related to the topic of the research questions but is unlikely to contain relevant answers.
1 point: The paper is unrelated to the topic of the research questions.
