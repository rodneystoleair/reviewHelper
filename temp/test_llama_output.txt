Based on the instructions, I would score this paper:

2 points: 

The title "Modern Pollenâ€“Vegetation Relationships" suggests that the paper addresses the topic of pollen-vegetation relationships. However, it does not explicitly indicate that it addresses the question of using pollen data to reconstruct past environments.

The abstract mentions palaeoecological research and analyzing pollen samples, which is related to the topic of reconstructing past environments. However, it does not provide specific information on using pollen data for this purpose.

While the paper may contain some relevant methods or data that could be useful for further investigation of the question, its focus seems to be more on understanding modern pollen-vegetation relationships in Central Siberia, rather than specifically addressing the question of using pollen data to reconstruct past environments.
