                                         sition is crucial for palaeoecological research. Here, we analyze 102 surface moss/soil pollen samples
                                         collected from four study regions located in various boreal forest vegetation types in Central Siberia.
                                         Despite Larix being the most prevalent tree generus in the study area, the proportion of Larix pollen
                                         can be as low as 0.6–1.5% (0.4–4.7% on average) even in localities with a high canopy density of
                                         the species. No relationship between the quantity of Larix pollen in the spectra and the abundance
                                         of Larix in the local vegetation was found. The dominant components of the pollen assemblages
                                         are Betula and Alnus fruticosa. The pollen value of Picea is low (2.6–8.2% on average), with higher
                                         proportions at sample plots where spruce is abundant in forests. Pinus is a highly prevalent pollen
                                         species within its geographical range, comprising up to 40% of pollen assemblages. Outside of
                                         the range, the ratio of Pinus pollen was higher in habitats with low canopy density and in treeless

                           Modern pollen data sets from Siberia have been published in previous
                      studies [13,20,32–37] and global pollen databases such as Eurasian Modern Pollen
                      Database [38]. Compared to other Northern Hemisphere regions, studies on surface pollen
                      assemblages are still rare for some regions such as Central Siberia. Few studies exploring
                      the relationships between pollen assemblages and vegetation or developing pollen–climate
                      transfer functions have been carried out on subfossil pollen spectra in northern Central
                      Siberia [13,20,39] and its southern part [19]. The subfossil pollen spectra of forest ecosys-
                      tems from the inner part of Central Siberia have so far been completely lacking due to the
                      non-accessibility of these regions for research.
                           One of the most important issues in palaeoecological research is the history of larch
                      forests and their modern dynamics. At present, these forests occupy large areas of
                      northern Eurasia, and during the Last Glaciation they greatly expanded their geograph-
                      ical range in the periglacial zone [40]. Larix is generally rare in pollen assemblages
                      due to thin exine, low pollen productivity, poor preservation and low wind transport
                      capacity [29,30,41]. As a result, its proportion in modern and fossil pollen assemblages
                      is usually underestimated. Therefore, new data on the composition of modern pollen
                      spectra from larch forests and their comparison with the surrounding vegetation are of
                      great importance for the interpretation of the results of palynological analysis.
                           Here, we present the results of a pollen analysis of 102 moss and soil samples collected
                      in four study regions in the permafrost zone of Central Siberia. The main objectives of this
                      study are to assess how modern pollen spectra reflect local and regional vegetation and
                      climatic conditions and how Larix is represented in pollen assemblages from different plant
                      communities and environments.

                      2. Regional Setting
                           Modern pollen assemblages and vegetation descriptions were obtained from key
                      regions (Igarka, Turukhansk, Tura and Vanavara) located in different landscape regions of
                      Central Siberia (Figure 1) across a broad vegetation gradient from the forest–tundra ecotone
                      (Igarka), through the northern taiga (Turukhansk and Tura) to the middle taiga vegetation
                      zone (Vanavara).
                           The study areas of Igarka and Turukhansk are located in the Yenisei River basin
                      within the gently undulating moraine and plain of the Late Pleistocene glaciation [42]
                      with an elevation range of 30–45 m a.s.l. (above sea level). The third area studied,
                      surrounding the Tura settlement, is in the middle basin of the Lower Tunguska River.
                      The Central Siberian Plateau in this region has an elevation range of approximately 140
                      to 600 m a.s.l. and is formed by Triassic igneous basalt. The last study region near the
                      Vanavara settlement occupies the southern part of the Tungusky State Nature Reserve in
                      the middle basin of the Podkamennya Tunguska River. The topography is represented
                      by a hilly plateau (400–500 m a.s.l.) of Palaeozoic sandstones and Triassic effusive rocks,
                      covered with their eluvium.
                           The climate type of the four study regions is subarctic (or subpolar) according to
                      the Köppen–Geiger climate classification, with long, usually very cold winters and short,
                      cool summers [45]. The mean annual air temperature and precipitation decreased toward
                      the inner part of Central Siberian Plateau [46] (Table 1). The Igarka and Tura regions are
                      part of the continuous permafrost zone. Turukhansk and Vanavara in the south have
                      discontinuous permafrost with up to 50% coverage of the region [47].
                           The area studied at Igarka belongs to the transitional zone between the forest–tundra
                      and northern taiga vegetation. Open larch, spruce–larch and pine–larch forests formed by
                      Larix sibirica Ledeb., Picea obovata Ledeb., Betula pendula Roth. and Pinus sibirica Du Tour
                      alternate with treeless peat bogs, extensive areas of early successional stands, which follow
                      clear cutting and fires.

                           The vegetation cover in Tura is dominated by northern taiga larch forests (Larix gmelinii
                      Rupr.) that are replaced by woodlands (Alnus fruticosa Rupr., B. nana L., B tortuosa Ledeb., B.
                      cajander Sukaczev) in the slopes of basalt plateaus [48]. The land cover around Vanavara is
                      a mosaic of mid-taiga pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and larch–pine forests, shrub thickets (Betula
                      nana), mostly frozen peatlands, and dark coniferous forests (Picea obovata, Pinus sibirica,
                      Abies sibirica Ledeb.) in river valleys.

                      3. Material and Methods
                             During the field campaigns in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, pollen samples were taken
                      from 102 sampling plots (Figure 2). A representative 10 m × 10 m square plot was used to
                      survey the modern vegetation composition at each site, and the cover of each plant species
                                                                                    tt or the top 2–3 cm of moss
                      was recorded. The first centimeter of soil below the plant litter
                           tt
                      matt were collected for a studying of surface pollen assemblages. Each sample consists of
                      five sub-samples, four taken near the corners of the study site and one in the center. Then,
                      all sub-samples were combined to form a single sample.

                      to [49]).

                            The diversity of the plant communities was classified into the following types: dense
                      forests (larch, pine, birch, spruce, mixed) with a crown density >0.4, open forests with
                      a crown density of 0.1–0.4, open woodlands with a crown density of 0.1 and peatlands,
                      mainly treeless. In addition, we identified burnt areas as a separate type of plant community
                      due to their specific vegetation.
                            A total of 102 surface samples were analyzed. During the preparation for pollen anal-
                      ysis, each sample was brought to a boil in a 10% solution of KOH, washed with distilled
                      water through a 120-micron mesh sieve to remove large plant debris [50] and processed
                      using a modified acetolysis procedure with propionic anhydride [51]. Hydrofluoric acid

                      was identified using a Zeiss Axio Lab A1 microscope at 400 magnifications. The identi-
                      fication was based on Reille [52], Beug [53] and the pollen collection of the Institute of
                      Geography RAS. More than 500 terrestrial pollen grains were counted in each sample.
                      The calculation of pollen percentages was based on the terrestrial pollen sum—arboreal
                      pollen (AP) plus non-arboreal pollen (NAP) without aquatic plants, spores and non-pollen
                      palynomorphs. The results of pollen analysis were plotted as pollen percentage graphs
                      using Tilia 3.0.1. software [54]. In the pollen diagrams, the samples are grouped by type of
                      plant community. We also identified similarities and differences between the spectra by
                      constrained incremental sum of squares cluster analysis [55], using the CONISS application
                      in the Tilia 2.0.2 program.
                            Taxa occurring in at least three samples with an abundance >1% were included in
                      the numerical analysis. To normalize biased distributions and reduce the effect of extreme
                      values, a square root transformation of all data was applied prior to the calculations.
                      Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate how well the pollen assemblages
                      characterize the different vegetation types [56]. Analyses were performed using R package
                      stats 3.6.2 [57] and package ggplot 2 3.5.1 [58] for graphical constraints.

                      4. Results
                      4.1. Tura
                           A total of 32 surface samples were collected in the Tura area (Figure 2) from 25 forest
                      and seven peatland sampling plots. According to our field observation, the forest plant
                      communities are represented by larch (Larix gmelinii) and birch (Betula pubescens, B.
                      pendula) forests with a range of canopy densities from closed forest to open woodland.
                      The shrub layers are formed by Alnus fruticosa, B. nana, Rosa acicularis Lindl. and several
                      species of Salix (S. lapponum L., S. reticulata L., S. rosmarinifolia L.). The coverage of
                      dwarf shrub and grass layer ranges from 10 to 45% and includes Vaccinium uliginosum
                      L., V. vitis-idaea L., Empetrum nigrum L., Ledum palustre L., different species of Carex and
                      Equisetum arvense L., E. palustre L., Calamagrostis langsdorffii (Link) Trin. Sphagnum, feather
                      mosses (Polytrichum commune Hedw., Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt.) and lichens form
                      the moss cover. The vegetation in the peatland is characterized by a mosaic plant cover
                      consisting of peat plateaus and perennial frost mounds covered by Betula nana, Ledum
                      palustre, lichens and feather mosses with a combination of frozen Sphagnum carpets with
                      abundant dwarf shrubs and Rubus chamaemorus L. and thawed hollows occupied by
                      diverse species of Carex and Eriophorum.
                           The analyzed pollen assemblages are composed predominantly (from 70 to 95%) of
                      arboreal pollen (Figure 3), which is mostly contributed by Betula, both tree and shrub birch.
                      The maximum amount of Betula alba (59.4%) is found in the dense birch forest. In other
                      pollen assemblages, its percentage ranges from 16 to 40%. The portion of B. nana varies in a
                      wide range from 0.3 to 47.3% (Table 2), but in most sampling locations, it does not exceed
                      10%. The share of Alnus fruticosa is very high and varies from 8.2 to 50.1%, with the mean
                      value of 27.3%. A generally higher proportion of Betula alba, B. nana and Alnus fruticosa
                      pollen is found in ecosystems with a high abundance of the species in local vegetation.
                      Cluster analysis revealed differences in the composition of pollen assemblages in various
                      habitats. The spectra of forest and non-forest habitats show significant variation, and the
                      spectra of dense larch forest and open forest are also well differentiated.
                           Although the samples come from different types of larch forest, the proportion of Larix
                      pollen varies from 0.6 to 13.5%, with the mean 4.7%. Relatively high proportions of Larix
                      pollen (7–10% and above) were found in both closed larch and open forests, as well as
                      in the assemblage from the treeless burnt area. At the same time, the proportion of Larix
                      pollen is only 1.1% in two larch forest habitats with a canopy density of 0.5.

                                         Picea pollen are found at all sampling plots, with the exception of one location in the
                                    swamp. The Picea pollen content ranges from 0.2 to 15.9%, but in most samples, it varies
                                    between 0.6 and 5%, with the mean of 3.5%. On the sampling plots with spruce present in
                                    the plant communities, its pollen content increases to 6–9%. In other samples, its proportion
                                    does not exceed 2%. Surprisingly, the highest percentages of Picea pollen (13.1 and 15.9%)
                                    are found in the two peatland habitats without spruce trees directly at the sampling points,
                                    but occurring in the vicinity of the peat bog.
                                         Pinus pollen is recorded at all sampling plots. The proportion of Pinus sylvestris ranges
                                    from 0.2 to 10.3%; the share of P. sibirica varies from 0.8 to 42.5%. The maximum pollen
                                    values of both pine species occur at peatlands, open woodlands or other treeless habitats.
                                         Rare pollen grains of shrubs such as Lonicera, Sorbus, Rosa and Juniperus are present in
                                    several samples. In the flooded birch forest, the proportion of Salix pollen rises to 33.5%; in
                                    other samples, it varies from 0.1 to 9.9%, with the mean being 3.2%.
                                         In the surface samples examined, pollen from thermophilic arboreal taxa transported
                                    over long distances was identified. Tilia pollen was detected in four pollen assemblages;
                                    Ulmus pollen was noted in one. Alnus pollen from the tree species of alder, which are
                                    morphologically distinct from Alnus fruticosa, have been recorded in a number of habitats.

                            Among the non-arboreal pollen Ericaceae, Poaceae and Cyperaceae dominate. The
                      proportion of Ericaceae ranges from 8 to 24% in the sampled areas where these dwarf
                      shrubs are abundant in local vegetation, while in other pollen assemblages their content
                      does not exceed 2–3%. The analysis revealed a wide variety of grass pollen (0.1–0.3%):
                      Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Rosaceae,
                      Fabaceae, Geraniaceae, Gentianaceae, Lamiaceae, Polemoniaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Va-
                      leriana, Thalictrum, Bistorta vivipara, Sanguisorba officinalis. Pollen from plants typical for
                      disturbed soils (Convolvulus, Rumex, Cichoriaceae) occurs in 1–2 pollen assemblages. Pollen
                      of Onagraceae genera, apparently belonging to Chamaenerion angustifolium, was found in
                      five sample plots. Pollen of wetland plants is presented by Rubus chamaemorus, Menyanthes
                      trifoliata, Pedicularis sp.
                            The sum of spores varies from 0.5 to 11% in comparison to the sum of AP + NAP. The
                      most abundant spore taxa are Sphagnum (0.2–2.2%), Polypodiaceae (0.2–7.9%), Lycopodium
                      annotinum (0.2–1.5%) and Equisetum (0.2–1.5%). Spores of Diphasiastrum complanatum, L.
                      clavatum, L. pungens, Huperzia selago and Selaginella selaginoides occur sporadically. Spores
                      of Sphagnum mosses and ferns are more abundant at sites where they occur in plant
                      communities. In other pollen assemblages, they are represented by 1–2 spores or are absent.

                      4.2. Igarka
                           A total of 23 pollen assemblages from Igraka were analyzed (Figure 4). Seventeen
                      sampling plots are located in forests and open woodlands formed by Larix sibirica, Larix
                      gmelinii, Picea obovata and Betula pendula with an admixture of Pinus sibirica. The shrub
                      layer is represented by Betula nana, Alnus fruticosa and Rosa acicularis; the dwarf-herb layer
                      includes Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Ledum palustre, Vaccinium uliginosum, Calamagrostis lapponica
                      (Wahlenb.) Hartm., Thalictrum sp., Equisetum sylvaticum L., Rubus arcticus L., Linnaea
                      borealis L., Lycopodium annotinum L. and L. clavatum L.; the moss cover is formed mainly
                      by Pleurozium schreberi (Willd. ex Brid.) Mitt. Vegetation of peatland (four sampling plots)
                      consists of perennial frost mounds (lichen, feather mosses, Betula nana, Ledum palustre and
                      Rubus chamaemorus) and flat, wide hollows with various species of Carex, feather mosses
                      and thickets of Betula nana. The burnt areas (two sampling plots) are covered with Betula
                      pendula and Alnus fruticosa with plenty of Ledum palustre, Vaccinium uliginosum, Equisetum
                      arvense and Carex.

                           Cluster analysis showed that pollen assemblages from different habitats fell into different
                      groups, indicating the influence of local vegetation on the composition of pollen spectra.
                           Pollen of trees and shrubs predominates in all samples (65–95%), with the main com-
                      ponents being Pinus sibirica (13.2–72.7%) and Betula alba-type (4.4–65.1%). The percentages
                      of Pinus and Betula are in the opposite phase to each other. Pollen of Alnus fruticosa, Picea
                      and B. nana accounts for a crucial part in pollen assemblages. The shares of B. nana and
                      Alnus fruticosa vary in a wide range from a few percent to 18.9% and 24.5%, respectively,
                      but at most sampling plots, the contribution of shrubby birch is 1–3% and that of shrubby
                      alder is 7–10%.
                           Larch is a dominant forest-forming tree in Igarka, but in larch forests, the pollen value
                      of Larix does not exceed 5.2% (Table 2), mainly 1–2% (Figure 4). In closed larch forests, the
                      share of Larix in the spectra is even slightly lower than in swamps, where single trees are
                      found on perennially frost mounds.
                           Picea pollen is present in all the pollen assemblages studied, with percentages varying
                      from 0.9 to 26.6%, and the mean value of 8.2% (Table 2). In sampling plots where spruce is
                      present in the local vegetation, e.g., in an open spruce forest, its pollen content increases to
                      about 20%; in other samples, it was 2.5–3%. However, the highest percentages of spruce
                      pollen appear in peatlands (26.6%) and open woodlands (23.4%), where rare, suppressed
                      spruce trees were found during field surveys.
                           Rare Abies pollen grains are recorded from 15 samples and they were obviously
                      transported from the southern regions.
                           Poaceae and Cyperaceae are more abundant in the NAP. The composition of herba-
                      ceous pollen and spores is similar to the pollen assemblages from the Tura area, except for
                      a higher proportion of Sphagnum 0.6 to 8.5%. Lycopodium annotinum spores exceed 10% in
                      one of the sampling plots within the peatland, but they were very abundant in the forest
                      adjacent to the peat bog.

                      4.3. Turukhansk
                           Pollen assemblages from the Turukhansk study area are represented by 19 samples col-
                      lected from 11 forest and eight peatland sampling plots (Figure 5). Forests are represented
                      by secondary birch (Betula pendula) and aspen (Populus tremula L.) woodlands with an
                      admixture of Larix gmelinii, L. sibirica and their hybrids with a combination of Picea–Betula
                      and Picea–Betula–Larix forests. The shrub layer is formed by Salix spp., Alnus fruticosa, B.
                      nana, Juniperus sibirica Burgsd, Sorbus sibirica Hedl. and Rosa acicularis; the dwarf-herb layer
                      included Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Ledum palustre, Vaccinium uliginosum, Equisetum arvense, Ma-
                      ianthemum bifolium (L.) F.W. Schmidt, Oxalis acetosella L. Lycopodium annotinum, L. clavatum;
                      moss cover is formed mainly by Pleurozium schreberi and Polytrichum strictum. In swamped
                      woodlands, feather mosses are replaced by Sphagnum. Ombrotrophic peatlands and reach
                      fen (eight sampling plots), mainly unfrozen, are covered by Betula nana, various species of
                      Salix, dwarf shrubs (Chamaedaphne calyculata (L.) Moench, Andromeda polifolia L., Vaccinium
                      uliginosum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and Carex. Moss cover is dominated by Sphagnum.
                           The main components of the pollen spectra are the most abundant forest-forming
                      trees, Pinus sibirica (10.1–74.4%, the mean 44.5%) and Betula alba-type (10.4–54.6%, the mean
                      28.9%), while the content of arboreal pollen varies from 40 to 97%. The percentages of Pinus
                      and Betula are in opposite phases. Pollen assemblages from forests and peatlands can be
                      clearly distinguished using cluster analysis (Figure 5).
                           There are no pure larch forests in the Turukhansk area. However, larch is present as
                      an admixture in other tree stands and, in some places, it is relatively abundant, Larix pollen
                      is found in only six samples (1–2 grains) without any relationship with the type of forest
                      communities. The mean value of Larix pollen content is 0.08%.

                            Picea is present in the pollen assemblages in small quantities (0.2–5.9%, Table 2) in almost
                      all samples, with the exception of two treeless wetland habitats. There is no difference in the
                      Picea pollen value between closed spruce and birch forests (Figure 4), which is apparently due
                      to the mosaic vegetation cover and the resulting averaging of the spectra.
                            Pinus sylvestris is constantly present at 1–3%. In one of the samples collected in a wetland,
                      the ﬀpollen value of Pinus sylvestris rose to 13%; that is where we found an isolated tree of this
                      pine species. Abies is registered in 10 pollen assemblages in the amount of 1–3 pollen grains.
                      Although the Turukhansk area lies within the geographical range of Abies sibirica, fir is rare,
                      but during the field work, we found some fir in both tree and shrub forms.
                            Unlike the study regions Tura and Igarka, shrub pollen is not abundant in Turukhansk.
                      Pollen values of Alnus fruticosa and Salix varies in a range 1–6%. The amount of Betula nana
                      pollen does not exceed 4% and it was not found in a number of samples. Rare pollen of
                      Rosa sibirica and Sorbus were registered.
                            Besides arboreal pollen from local and regional vegetation, long-distance Tilia and
                      Carpinus pollen grains were identified.
                            The percentages of non-arboreal pollen sum range from 4.7 to 29%. The exceptions are
                      the peaks in two moss samples mainly due to Poaceae (up to 37%) and Cyperaceae (up to
                      45%). The composition of the NAP does not differ much from other study areas. It should
                      be noted that Ericaceae pollen content is low (0.1–1.7%) and is often absent.
                            Sphagnum spores are abundant in peatlands (79.3 and 57.8%). In the other samples,
                      the share of Sphagnum does not exceed a few percent. Spores of Lycopodium annotinum, L.
                      clavatun and L. pungens are present, but not abundant. Polypodiaceae spores are a major
                      part (26.2%) of a sample taken in a spruce forest with abundant ferns in the herbaceous
                      layer; in other habitats, their spores are rare.

                      4.4. Vanavara
                           A total of 28 modern pollen assemblages have been examined for the Vanavara area
                      (Figure 6). Nineteen study sites represent the forest vegetation formed by pine (Pinus
                      sylvestris; six sampling plots), larch–pine and larch forests (Larix sibirica, L gmelinii and their
                      hybrids; five sampling plots), wet habitats occupied by birch forests (Betula pendula; three
                      sampling plots) and dark coniferous forests (Pinus sibirica, Picea obovata, Abies sibirica; five
                      sampling plots) located in the valleys of Podkamennya Tunguska River and its tributaries.

Land 2024, 13, 1939                                                                                            10 of 18



                      Open wet woodlands (five sampling plots) are formed by Larix, with the participation of
                      Pinus sibirica, Betula pendula and Picea obovata. Alnus fruticosa and Betula nana are most often
                      found in the understory, while Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium uliginosum are common
                      in the dwarf shrub cover; Pleurozium schreberi and Sphagnum dominates among mosses.
                      The vegetation mosaic of the peatland (four sampling plots) includes frozen peat plateau
                      and perennial frost mounds covered by Cladonia, B. nana and dwarf shrubs. Thermokarst
                      depressions and thawed hollows were occupied by various species of Carex, Eriophorum
                      and Sphagnum mosses.                               ﬀ

                            The results of the pollen analysis (Figure 6) showed that AP (85–97%) is dominated by
                      Betula, Pinus sylvestris and Alnus fruticosa. The CONISS results clearly show the diversity of
                      pollen assemblages produced by different types of plant communities.
                            The pollen content of Pinus sylvestris varies from 2.4 to 73.1, with an average of 36.2%
                      (Table 2). Much lower (0.2–3.6%) is the share of Pinus sibirica. The amount of Betula alba-type
                      ranges from 13.1% to 78.5%, averaging 43.7% with Betula nana ranging from 0.4 to 6.2%.
                      Alnus fruticosa ranged from 0.4 to 11.7%. The exceptions are the habitats where shrubs are
                      abundant in local plant communities. For example, in pollen assemblages from open birch
                      woodlands with a dense shrub layer of Alnus fruticosa, its pollen value reaches 57.3% and
                      that from spruce forest 26.2%. Betula nana increased to 29.1% in the pollen spectra of shrub
                      thickets formed by dwarf birch.
                            Larix pollen was found only in seven sampling plots with low amounts: from 0.2 to
                      3.5%. The mean value is 0.4% (Table 2). It is noteworthy that in pollen assemblages from
                      larch forests with a Larix crown density of 0.5, no Larix pollen was recorded. However,
                      Larix pollen has occasionally been found in pine and spruce forests where larch is present
                      as an admixture in forest stands. The highest value of Larix (3.5%) occurred in open larch
                      woodland with a canopy density of about 0.1.
                            Picea pollen was recorded in all sampling plots (0.2–13.4%; the mean 2.6%), but is
                      significantly more abundant in pollen assemblages from closed spruce forests (6–8%) than

Land 2024, 13, 1939                                                                                                  11 of 18



                      in other habitats (0.2–3%). In the spectra of open spruce woodlands and in peatlands, where
                      spruce also grows, the amount of Picea pollen increases up to 5%.
                           The NAP group is not abundant and poor. Pollen of the most common plant genera
                      and families were identified, with a proportion not exceeding 1%. In samples from peatland
                      habitats, the pollen content of Ericaceae, Poaceae and Cyperaceae increased to 5–10%.
                      Spores are represented by Sphagnum (0.2–1.5%) and rare spores of Polypodiaceae, Lycopodium
                      annotinum, L. clavatum and L. pungens.

                      4.5. Principal Component Analysis
                           The share of variance explained by the first and second PCs (principal components)
                      was 20% and 17.2%, respectively. The biplot in Figure 7 shows that temperature regime
                      (PC1) and climate continentality (PC2) are apparently critical factors affecting the distri-
                      bution of vegetation and pollen assemblages in the permafrost zone of Central Siberia.
                      The PCA results revealed that the pollen assemblages are clearly separated into three
                      distinct clusters corresponding to the study regions: the southernmost study region in
                      Central Siberia (Vanavara) with the prevalence of Betula alba and Pinus sylvestris, the
                      center study region in Central Siberia (Tura) with Alnus fructicosa, Larix, Betula nana,
                      Ericaceae and Yenisei Siberia (Igarka and Turukhansk) with Pinus sibirica, Picea, Poaceae,
                      Cyperaceae, Sphagnum. Despite the proximity of the pollen assemblages at Igarka and Tu-
                      rukhansk, their differences are determined, emphasizing a positive correlation between
                      pollen and vegetation.

                      5. Discussion
                          Data from 102 surface samples from four study regions in the permafrost zone of
                      Central Siberia showed that the composition and the ratio of components in the tree and
                      shrub pollen group must be carefully analyzed for interpretation.

Land 2024, 13, 1939                                                                                              12 of 18



                      5.1. The Proportion of Larix in Modern Pollen Assemblages
                           The results of the analysis revealed that the predominant components in the pollen
                      assemblages from the larch forests in Tura were Betula and Alnus fruticosa, and Pinus and
                      Betula in those from three other study regions (Figure 8). The proportion of Larix in pollen
                      assemblages is notably underestimated in relation to its participation in the plant communities.




                      Figure 8. The proportion of the arboreal species in modern pollen assemblages from Central Siberia
                      in relation to their geographical ranges.

                             Our data indicated that the proportion of larch in the spectra reaches its maximum
                      values in Tura (0.6–13.5%, average value 5.2%), where Larix gmelinii and Betula pendula
                      are the dominant tree species. Although the geographical range of Picea obovata and Pinus
                      sibirica reaches the Tura area (Figure 1), these species are rare in the forests and grow in the
                      most favorable habitats. In Igarka, besides Larix gmelinii and Larix sibirica, a great portion
                      of forest stands are Picea obovata, Betula pendula and Pinus sibirica. Larix pollen occurs in
                      all pollen assemblages from Igarka, but its value does not exceed 5.2%, the mean value
                      being 1.5%. In other areas, Betula, Pinus sibirica (Turukhansk) and Pinus sylvestris (Vanavara)
                      dominate the forest stands. Although larch makes up a significant proportion of the forest,
                      it is only present in 1–3 pollen grains in a third of the pollen assemblages studied.

Land 2024, 13, 1939                                                                                           13 of 18



                            Palynologists who studied the history of larch forests and vegetation changes in the
                      regions with larch occurrence have constantly noted the discrepancy between the presence
                      of larch pollen in the assemblages and its share in the vegetation [29,30,59,60]. For example,
                      in surface samples from larch forests of the Timan Peninsula (Komi Republic, Russia), the
                      Larix pollen content varies from 0.6 to 5.0% [61] (here and below, the percentages of pollen
                      taxa are given from the sum of AP + NAP; if the authors used other calculation methods,
                      the percentages were recalculated). In the larch forests of northern Sakhalin, the proportion
                      of Larix pollen can reach 12.3%, with the mean of 1.5% [62]. Studies in the larch wooded
                      tundra of the Lena River delta have shown that rare pollen grains of Larix can be found
                      everywhere. However, in areas close to mature larch trees, the proportion of Larix pollen
                      increased to 4–10% [35]. A mean of 2.4% of Larix pollen has been revealed in the wooded
                      tundra of the southern Taymyr Peninsula, Khatanga River basin [30]. The average value
                      of Larix in the pollen assemblages from the larch forests of the Indigirka River basin was
                      about 3% [39].
                            The question remains controversial: what value of Larix pollen percentages can be
                      used to prove the growth of larch in the area studied? For northern Europe, Lisitsyna
                      et al. [63] suggested 0.5%, while Klemm et al. [39], based on a large surface dataset from
                      the north of eastern Siberia, considered this value to be underestimated and recommended
                      2% as the limit for larch presence in regional vegetation. Our results revealed that the
                      proportion of Larix pollen can be 0.6–1.5%, even in the dense larch forests of the Tura area,
                      where the maximum amount of larch pollen was found. It should be noted that these
                      samples were characterized by very good pollen preservation and a large number of pollen
                      grains counted, reducing the possibility of errors.

                      5.2. The Proportion of Picea and Pinus in Modern Pollen Assemblages
                            Picea obovata grows in the studied region as an admixture in larch and pine–larch
                      forests. The share of its pollen in the spectra is low (2.6–8.2 in average, Table 2), which
                      underestimates the participation of spruce in the forest communities. There is a pattern
                      of an increase in the portion of Picea pollen in the assemblages at habitats where spruce
                      is part of the plant community or grows nearby. In Igarka, where spruce has the largest
                      proportion in the vegetation compared to other areas, the maximum level (up to 26.6%) of
                      spruce pollen is found (Figure 8).
                            Pinus pollen is present in all surface samples examined. The growing area of Pinus
                      sibirica covers the entire study region (Figure 1). In Tura and Igarka, Pinus sibirica is close
                      to the range boundary [44]. However, according to our field observations, Pinus sibirica
                      is a common tree in Igaraka, but very rare in Tura due to the more continental climate.
                      The northern limit of the range of Pinus sylvestris in the middle reaches of the Nizhnyaya
                      Tunguska River is located about 150 km west of the Tura region and crosses the valley of
                      the Yenisei River at Turukhansk. (Figure 1). Our data showed that in regions outside the
                      geographical range of the pines, the proportion of pollen from both pine species reaches its
                      maximum values in sampling plots located in treeless peatlands and in open woodlands
                      or burnt areas. As several pollen studies have shown, due to the filtering effect of the
                      canopy and the high pollen productivity of the trees, the contribution of wind-transported
                      pollen from distant areas is significantly lower under the forest canopy than in open
                      habitats [11,13,19,64]. Therefore, the proportion of pine pollen increases in treeless or
                      very low canopy density plant communities [65]. Some researchers even use Pinus pollen
                      content or the Pinus/Larix ratio as an indicator of increasing landscape openness in Arctic
                      regions [20].
                            In contrast to the Tura area, Pinus sibirica is one of the most common tree species
                      in Igarka and Turukhansk. The proportion of Pinus in the pollen assemblages increased
                      markedly (Figure 8). The average pollen values increase from 8.2% in Tura to more than
                      40% in the other areas.
                            Beyond the geographical range, the pollen content of Pinus sylvestris is about 2–3% on
                      average, but in Vanavara, where Pinus sylvestris is the most common tree, the mean value

Land 2024, 13, 1939                                                                                               14 of 18



                      of this pine species pollen has increased to 36.2%. In most of the pollen assemblages, the
                      proportion of pollen from birch—the second most important tree in the forest—is between
                      20 and 35%. The share of Betula and Pinus pollen is greatly overestimated in relation to the
                      amount of birch and pine present in the forest stands. A similar phenomenon has been
                      described in forests where the pollen productivity of the main forest-forming species is
                      lower than that of pine and birch, not only in larch forests but also in spruce dominated
                      stands [19,29,31,37]. Our data show that the percentages of Pinus and Betula are in opposite
                      phases in pollen assemblages from Central Siberia within the Pinus areal.

                      5.3. The Proportion of Shrubs in Modern Pollen Assemblages
                           The participation of shrubs in pollen assemblages clearly depends on the vegetation
                      pattern of the study areas and the pollen productivity of these species. Alnus fruticosa, a
                      wind-pollinated shrub species with a high pollen productivity like all species of alder [29,30],
                      is widespread in the study area, so it is not surprising that it has a relatively high pollen value.
                      In sampling plots where the shrub alder is abundant in the local vegetation, the contribution
                      of Alnus fruticosa pollen rises to 45–50%. In Tura, there are significantly more habitats with
                      high populations of Alnus fruticosa than in other areas. It forms thickets in burnt areas as well
                      as undergrowth. Therefore, Alnus fruticosa is the main component of the pollen assemblages
                      in Tura (average value 27.3%), while in the other study regions, its share does not exceed 7–8%.
                      The percentage of Betula nana is high in plots where it dominates the local vegetation, such
                      as shrub thickets on frozen peat plateaus and perennial frost mounds. The amount of Salix
                      pollen is also dependent on the environmental conditions in the area.

                      5.4. The Long-Distance Transported Taxa in Modern Pollen Assemblages
                           The pollen of Tilia, Ulmus, Carpinus and Alnus sp. are exotic to the flora of the region
                      under study. The areal boundaries of these tree species are thousands of kilometers away
                      from the permafrost zone of Central Siberia [44]. The transfer of pollen of broad-leaved
                      trees and various conifers to the Arctic and to regions with severe climates far beyond their
                      native range has been well documented in pollen studies [32]. For example, single pollen
                      grains of Tilia and Alnus have been found in surface samples in the Polar Urals [66] and in
                      the lake sediments in the north of Taimyr [67]. Rare pollen from various pine species is a
                      typical phenomenon for Arctic regions, both in Europe [37,68] and in Siberia [35,69].

                      5.5. The Composition of Non-Arboreal Pollen and Spores in Modern Pollen Assemblages
                            The composition and the ratio of taxa in the NAP group reflect the main patterns of
                      species composition and abundance of the various herbaceous plants in the vegetation
                      cover, as far as possible they were determined by pollen analysis. Detailed studies of the
                      composition of modern flora and vegetation of the study area showed that herbaceous
                      plants in forest communities are represented by Ericaceae, Rosaceae and Poaceae [70].
                      Pollen from these families is most commonly recorded in pollen assemblages. In wetland
                      habitats, the proportion of Cyperaceae pollen increases due to the important role of sedges
                      and cottongrass (Eriophorum) in the local vegetation. Rubus chamaemorus and Menyanthes
                      trifoliata are the common taxa in spectra from peatland.
                            The pollen of plants that are typical of habitats with disturbed or undeveloped soil and
                      vegetation cover is present in the majority of the sampling plots. We include in this group
                      of pollen Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia, Plantago, Urtica, Convolvulus, Polygonum aviculare-type
                      and Rumex. The family Chenopodiaceae is represented in the study area by only three
                      species, namely Chenopodium acerifolium Andrz., Ch. Rubrum L. and Ch. Suecicum Murr. [71],
                      which grow on roadsides or on the banks of rivers and lakes, and on pebbles. There
                      are five species of Artemisia, the most common of which are Artemisia vulgaris L., which
                      grows in burnt areas and on the edges of larch forests, and Artemisia laciniata Willd., a
                      species of meadow steppe [72]. Onagraceae pollen, obviously belonging to Chamaenerion
                      angustifolium, is present in a number of samples. This is an indicator of burnt areas, which
                      are common in the study region.

Land 2024, 13, 1939                                                                                                              15 of 18



                                       Although the group of spores is not very abundant, characteristic species of taiga
                                  forests were identified, such as Lycopodium annotinum, L. clavatum (most frequently found
                                  in the study area), as well as Diphasiastrum complanatum and Huperzia selago. The presence
                                  of Selaginella selaginoides spores should be noted. It is a circumpolar hypoarcto-montane
                                  species, very rare in the Angara–Tunguska province, and its occurrence has not been
                                  recorded in our study regions [72].

                                  6. Conclusions
                                       A study of 102 modern pollen assemblages from various plant communities across the
                                  larch biome in Central Siberia has enabled us to reach the following conclusions.
                                       1. Despite larch being the most prevalent tree species in the study area, the dominant
                                  components of the pollen assemblages are Betula, Alnus fruticosa and Pinus. The discrepancy
                                  in the pollen–vegetation relationship can be explained by differences in pollen productivity,
                                  distribution features and the pollen resistance to decomposition of various arboreal plants.
                                  The proportion of larch pollen (0.4–4.7% on average) is underestimated in relation to its
                                  participation in vegetation. It is notable that even in larch forests with a high canopy
                                  density, the contribution of Larix can be as low as 0.6–1.5%. Thus, there is no relationship
                                  between the amount of larch pollen in the spectra and the abundance of the larch in local
                                  vegetation. The share of Picea pollen is also underestimated in comparison to its ratio in
                                  forests. The pollen value of Picea is relatively low (2.6–8.2% on average), with higher values
                                  observed at sample plots where spruce is part of the forest stand.
                                       2. Pinus pollen is an imported component of pollen spectra in the inner part of Central
                                  Siberia (Tura model area), located outside the range of Pinus sylvestris and close to the limit
                                  of Pinus sibirica distribution. Our data revealed that the proportion of pollen from both
                                  pine species increased in habitats with low canopy density or treeless sites. This suggests
                                  that Pinus pollen value can be used as an indicator of increased landscape openness. The
                                  proportion of Pinus pollen within the geographical range (study areas Turukhansk, Igarka
                                  and Vanavara) is significantly higher. However, we assume that analysis of macro-remains
                                  (seeds, needles, bark, wood, etc.) would be needed to reach a more accurate interpretation
                                  of the fossil pollen assemblages and to confirm whether pine trees were present in the study
                                  area in the past.
                                       3. The composition of the NAP group is strongly influenced by local conditions. Pollen
                                  from plants characteristic of taiga forests, peatlands and meadows, as well as indicators of
                                  disturbed soils and burnt areas, were identified, allowing for more detailed reconstructions
                                  of local vegetation.
